Trying to make a app to:
1)learn more about java and how to make an own app.
2)make an app to help myself to see my expendures

Functionalities that need to be incorporated:
--------------------------------------------
*read input from a csv (most often used are excell documents, so most usefull for incorporation)
*json/xml tracking/saving of the data
*be able to create different classes
  -be able to set elements like gain/expendures (so gaining money like wages or expending money for buying food)
  -be able to sort on class per month (see fluctuations in expense/income)
*making graphs
